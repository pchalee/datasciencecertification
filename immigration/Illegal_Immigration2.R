#This comparision is nice but it is based on the Sectors with the 8 highest arrest total from 2000.  It is
# possible that in later years the Sectors with the highest arrest totals changed.  Also we can only see
# the arrest totals from 4 of the 17 years that we have data on.  Unfortunately, adding more years to this plot
# would make it too hard to read, and it would be tedious to rewrite the code for a bar plot 17 times to look
# at the information for each year individually. For this reason I chose to write a function that can find the
# Sectors with the 8 highest arrest totals for a given year and create a bar plot comparing the arrest totals
# for all illegal immigrants and mexican immigrants for that year.
